                he successfully manufactured a gyroscope in the UC Davis workshop. 
                Also, he was a leader and designer for the campus farm project, 
                where he and his team designed an automatic irrigation system for grapes. 
                In his sophomore year, he decided to take Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Science and Engineering. 
                He has learned aircraft stability, structures, propulsion, and aerodynamics and he finished his senior project, 
                the aircraft performance and design.
